    <h1>Compatibilty</h1>

    <p>
      GoGui will work with all programs that can understand
      the most basic commands of version 1 or 2 of the
      <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/">Go Text Protocol</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Required commands</h2>

    <p>
      It is required that the Go program can handle the following
      commands:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><tt>boardsize</tt> (<tt>boardsize</tt>, <tt>clear_board</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>black</tt>, <tt>white</tt> (<tt>play</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>genmove_black</tt>, <tt>genmove_white</tt> (<tt>genmove</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>name</tt></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The commands in braces are used if the program supports
      the <tt>protocol_version</tt> command and responds with 2.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular the Go program is not required to support
      the <tt>loadsgf</tt> command.
      GoGui translates all moves, setup and handicap stones into a series of
      <tt>black</tt>, <tt>white</tt> (<tt>play</tt>) commands.
    </p>

    <h2>Optional commands</h2>

    <p>
      The following other commands are used by GoGui.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><tt>help</tt> (<tt>list_commands</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>komi</tt></li>
      <li><tt>quit</tt></li>
      <li><tt>scoring_system</tt></li>
      <li><tt>undo</tt></li>
      <li><tt>version</tt></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If the Go program does not understand them
      you will still be able to play games,
      but you cannot use all of the functionality of GoGui.
    </p>

    <p>
      The command <tt>scoring_system</tt> (from an early draft of GTP
      version 2 ) is used for setting Japanese or Chinese rules,
      if the program supports it.
      Otherwise the rule settings are quietly ignored.
    </p>

    <h2>Interrupting programs</h2>

    <p>
      If the program understands the GoGui specific extension GTP command
      <tt>gogui_sigint</tt>, it indicates that long commands can be
      interrupted by sending it a SIGINT signal. The program must return its
      process id as an answer to <tt>gogui_sigint</tt> and GoGui will
      try to send interrupt signals by using
      <tt>kill&nbsp;-INT&nbsp;&lt;pid&gt</tt>. Note that this feature works
      only on operating systems that have a <tt>kill</tt> command.
